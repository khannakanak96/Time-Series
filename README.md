# Time-Series
 I have constructed a linear regression model to predict the return of a ticker, given the returns of an index (SPY).  I have sourced the data, assemble it into a useful form, and transform it as needed.  Finally, I used sklearn to build the model and evaluate it using the RMSE Performance metric.
